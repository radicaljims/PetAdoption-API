## Synopsis

The Pet Adoption API is a project using the MEAN stack. The database and API are currently hosted in Azure Platform (via Mlab and Bitnami). Image assests are stored with Amazon S3.

## Motivation

Nobody likes to see animals be put down due to overcrowding at animal control centers and shelters.  We would like to see animals at these facilities be adopted at a much higher rate, and for those animals who were lost and found, for their rightful owners to be reunited with them once more.  We would like to thank the City of Lady Lake for their wonderful contribution to the project, as they are the project's pilot city.  For that, we are ever grateful!

## Installation

run `npm install`

## Docker Services

If you are new to containers, run through the Docker hello world here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockerizing/

To use Docker Compose to run the PetApi and Mongo services together:

1. `./start_services.sh` or `docker-compose up --build -d`
2. `./stop_services.sh` or `docker-compose stop`

**TODO / Warning** - the mongo container is being started without the `--auth` flag, which probably makes it less secure than you want.

## Deployment

Look at the instructions in `DEPLOY.md`.

#### Queries


##### Additional POST fields you can set:

Name           | Type            | Description
---------------| ----------------| ----------------------------------------------------------
ignoreCase     | (String) Array  | Allows the fields specified to ignore casing
matchStartFor  | (String) Array  | Requires the fields specified in the array to match starting from the beginning (prepends a '^' line start regex meta-character)
matchEndFor    | (String) Array  | Requires the fields specified in the array to match from the ending (appends a '$' line end regex meta-character)
properties     | (String) Array  | Will only supply fields specified in array
pageSize       | Number          | Defaults to 10 (only meaningful when making paged query)

##### Additional GET request parameters you can set:

Name           | Type            | Description
---------------| ----------------| ----------------------------------------------------------
pageSize       | Number          | Defaults to 10 (only meaningful when making paged query)
properties     | (String) Array  | Will only supply fields specified in array. ex: `?properties=['species','petName','sex']` (Must not include spaces between field names)


###### More Notes

`api/v2` will only send values for request animals. `api/v1` will send the value for an animal property as well as an example, default value, type, etc. as available.

## Tests

Execute `npm run test`

#####TODO*
- [ ] More tests could always be helpful
- [ ] Web interface could use more UX consistency. Suggestions are welcome.


## Developer Notes
- `gulp-utils` provides easy compilation of javascript, stylus, and pug/jade files.
    + you can can read more about how it works on its [github repo](https://github.com/khalidhoffman/gulp-utils)
    + `gulp --tasks` shows a list of all possible tasks, but you'll probably only want to use:
        - `gulp build-webpack` (for compiling web-interface js)
        - `gulp pug-html` (for angular template files)
        - `gulp stylus` (for style overrides)
